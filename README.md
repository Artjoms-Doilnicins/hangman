# Hangman Game

[https://artjoms-doilnicins.github.io/hangman/](https://artjoms-doilnicins.github.io/hangman/)

A classic and interactive word-guessing game where players must uncover the hidden word by guessing one letter at a time before the hangman is fully drawn.

This project uses **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to deliver a fun and visually engaging browser-based game. It features smooth interaction, visual feedback, and persistent score tracking via localStorage.

## Features

- Random word selection from a predefined list.
- Keyboard input handling and guess validation.
- Display and update of correct and wrong guesses.
- Dynamic updates to the hangman SVG drawing.
- End-game logic to show win/loss messages.
- Persistent score storage using localStorage.

## How It Works

1. Start typing to guess letters of a hidden word.
2. Each wrong guess adds a new part to the hangman.
3. Guess the full word before the hangman is complete.
4. Win or lose, a message pops up with a "Play Again" button.
5. Your wins and losses are saved locally and shown on screen.
